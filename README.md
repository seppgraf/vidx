Linux virtual input device driver to control a Moving Head per Joystick


The idea is to control a Moving Head (Pan/Tilt) over a PS4 Dualschock Joystick for example using QLC+. 
The idea of this driver is to enable a better control, for example by converting the relativ joystick position into movment speed.
